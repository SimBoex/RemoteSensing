# RemoteSensing
Here I include some projects in python for remote sensing!

1. For the NDVI:
  the script is taken from [here](https://medium.com/rotten-grapes/download-sentinel-data-within-seconds-in-python-8cc9a8c3e23c)
  adapted using infos from [here](https://github.com/bnsreenu/python_for_microscopists/blob/master/201_geotiff_using_rasterio.py)

2. For the semantic segmenation:
   I used wandb for the first time and applied a procedure learnt during the university to fine tune the hyperparameters without using a ton of GPU.
   Some code and ideas is taken from [here](https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalSreeni)
